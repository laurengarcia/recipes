On the grill outside
  Start fire with charcoals piled up in a corner
  Let them burn with a flame for 15 mins

Combine the main ingredients in a bowl
  You can put the meat back in fridge while you tend the grill
  so that meat gets firm & doesnt fall off kebab

After 15 mins spread the coals out evenly on the grill
  Cook each side of kebab, turning every couple minutes
  Outside should be carmelized, inside juicy but cooked all the way thru
  Control the heat for best effect (no flame just coals)
  Grill the lemon & veggies on the side
  Squeeze the lemon onto fresh onion slices to eat with kebabs
